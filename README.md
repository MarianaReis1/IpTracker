# IP and URL Address Tracker
IpTracker is a beatiful simple Webapp to help you track IP and URLs. 
The code was concieved with a mobile first approach, taking advantage of ReactJsâ€™s tools to keep it simple and to make best and fastes use of the API.

This project was based on a challenge from Frontend Mentor, to improve my skills in a real-life workflow.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 
To get the IP Address locations, you'll be using the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/).
