# IP Address Tracker
IpTracker is a user-friendly web application that helps you track IPs and URLs. 
This project was part of a challenge from Frontend Mentor.
I used Google API to get the IP Address locations and Google Maps JavaScript to generate the map. 
The UI was conceived with a mobile-first approach, taking advantage of ReactJs' tools to keep all styles and components simple and make the fastest use of the API
