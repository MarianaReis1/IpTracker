# IP Address Tracker
IpTracker is a user-friendly web application that helps you track IPs and URLs. 
This project was part of a challenge from Frontend Mentor.
I used Google API to get the IP Address locations and Google Maps JavaScript to generate the map. 
The UI was conceived with a mobile-first approach, taking advantage of ReactJs' tools to keep all styles and components simple and make the fastest use of the API


## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 
To get the IP Address locations, you'll be using the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/).
